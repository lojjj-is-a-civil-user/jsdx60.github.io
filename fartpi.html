"hey thats me!" - Fartpi
<p><b>About Fartpi:</b></p>
Fartpi is a butt that came out of his creater; Mrs. doob which is allowed to have her breeds sticking out.
She is a real girl in the show but she play polybius lol, looping object guy pointer or Mr. doob putted down
a deck of cards (as seen <a href="Https://mrdoob.com/">here</a>) for Fartpi. Fartpi picked Winning Solitare
and saw the animation each time he tapped. He decided to teach Solitare on Vimeo but those videos sadly failed,
because he was not good at Solitare and never practiced in a long time. People called him "dumb", "stupid",
or something like that. For revenge, Fartpi decided to teach people on butts for enternity. Although he had 0
subscribers, that video got so popular, that Mrs. Doob's breeds hugged Fartpi, and Fartpi loved that, he made
videos of him getting destroyed, making more dumb mistakes on Solitare, getting punished, and made millions.
Fartpi's videos on youtube are still up today
